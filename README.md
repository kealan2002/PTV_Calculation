# PTV_Calculation
This Python program calculates the CLinical Target Volume (CTV) and Planning Target Volume (PTV) based on user inputs for the Gross Tumour Volume (GTV) and applies standard expansion margins as per the EViQ guidelines for different tumour sites. 

Features: 
Calculates GTV radius from the user provided volume, assuming a spherical shape. 
Applies site-specific GTV to CTV expansion margins automatically based on EviQ guidelines.
Allows the user to input a custom PTV expansion margin.
Calculates and displays to the user  the radii and volumes for GTV, CTV and PTV.
Handles user input errors with appropriate error messages.
